### Problem: 

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...`

where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The next number in the sequence is `13` because it is the result of `8 + 5`

Create a function fib() that takes an integer n and returns the nth fibonacci number in the sequence. 
*Example:*

`fib(5) //returns 3` 

Function returns 3 because 3 is the 5th integer in the fibonacci sequence.
