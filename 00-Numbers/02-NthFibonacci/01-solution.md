### Solutions:

By default we know that the first two numbers in the sequence are  ` 0, 1`. Also, we know that:

`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`

Understanding these two things are important for our solutions. We need to then calculate the fibonacci number for any `n` greater than 2. We also know that the best solution we can achieve is `O(n)` because any time we need to iterate through n numbers, sort n numbers, or do anything requiring us to go through n numbers the best time complexity we can achieve is `O(n)`.

#### Recursive Solution
We can use recusion to solve this problem since we already know our two base cases.

```javascript
    if(n==2){
        return 1;
    } else if(n == 1){
        return 0;
    }
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
```

The problem with this solution is the time complexity. This solution would take `O(2^n)` which is extremely slow. 

Lets assume we called the function passing `n=6`. We can draw the following graph of recursive calls:

```
                                            fib(6)
                                   ----------|  |-------------
                                  /                            \
                                 /                              \
                              fib(5)                          fib(4)
                            /       \                          /   \
                      fib(4)         fib(3)                fib(3)  fib(2)   
                      /   \           /    \                /  \
                fib(3)   fib(2)   fib(2)  fib(1)       fib(2)  fib(1)  
                /   \
            fib(2)  fib(1)                          

``` 
We can see that each call to `fib(n)` makes two more recursive calls and since we need to calculate `n` numbers our time complexity become `O(2^n)`.

* Time Complexity: `O(2^n)`
* Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Another thing we notice is we calculate the same numbers multiple times such as `fib(3), and fib(4)`. We can improve this solution using a technique called Memoization.

#### Recursion Solution with Memoization

So whats memoization? 

Memoization is an optimization technique that speeds up applications by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Using memoization, we no longer compute numbers we have previously computed. Instead, we compute a number once, store its result, and return the computed result if that same number is called again.
* [Memoization in Java](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/memoization)
* [Memoization in Javascript](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-memoization-in-javascript)

Using Memoization with Recursion we achieve the following time and space complexities:
* Time Complexity: `O(n)`
* Space Complexity: `O(n)`

This is a significant improvement from our previous solution. Looking back at our previous graph we can see which calculation are from the cache:

```
                                            fib(6)
                                   ----------|  |-------------
                                  /                            \
                                 /                              \
                              fib(5)                          fib(4)-cache 
                            /       \                          
                      fib(4)        fib(3)-cache               
                      /   \           
              fib(3)   fib(2)-cache    
              /   \
    fib(2)-cache  fib(1)-cache   

```

#### Iterative Solution

Instead of using recursion, we can also use an iterative solution where we continue calculating the fibonacci sequence until we reach position `n`.
